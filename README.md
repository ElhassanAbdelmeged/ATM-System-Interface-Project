# Payment Application (ATM) System Interface Project

**Project by:** Elhassan Abd El Meged Mohamed Ahmed
**Organization:** Egypt FWD

**Project Description:**

This project involves the development of a payment application using the C programming language. The application simulates a comprehensive payment system consisting of three main components:
1. **Card Module:**
   - Header File: `card.h`
   - Source File: `card.c`

2. **Terminal Module:**
   - Header File: `terminal.h`
   - Source File: `terminal.c`

3. **Server Module:**
   - Header File: `server.h`
   - Source File: `server.c`

In addition to the modules, there is an `app` module represented by:
- `payment_Application.c`

Furthermore, the project includes a standard types header file:
- `std_types.h`

This modular organization facilitates clarity and maintainability in the project's structure and codebase."


**Technologies Used:**

- C Programming Language

**Project Purpose:**

The main purpose of this project is to create a robust payment application that can simulate real-world payment scenarios. It allows for testing and development of various transaction types, providing a valuable learning experience for understanding payment systems.

This payment application project serves as a practical interface for studying and experimenting with different payment transactions and their interactions between the card, terminal, and server components.
